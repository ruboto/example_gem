# ExampleGem

This is an example of how to release platform specific gems.
Included at this time is Ruboto specific version,
but contact us if you would like to add another version.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'example_gem'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install example_gem

## Usage

This gem will probably never get any features :)
